That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put together this guide on flower care &amp; plant care tips to ensure your luxury arrangements live a long and happy life once they\u2019ve been delivered to you or a loved one.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n\t\t\n<style>\n#text-435328250 {\n  font-size: 0.9rem;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n<\/style>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<div id=\"text-643371231\" class=\"text\">\n\t\t\n<h5>WHEN YOUR FLOWERS ARRIVE<\/h5>\n<p>Upon receiving your fresh florals, be sure to unwrap them with care to make sure that none of the petals become damaged or bruised. If we have arranged your florals, please make sure not to remove the tie around the flower stems, as doing so will cause your arrangement to lose its structure.<\/p>\n<p>All <a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\">LULLY &amp; ROSE florals<\/a> are delivered wrapped in fresh water so that they arrive to you dewy and hydrated, and don\u2019t lose any moisture on their journey to you. This helps to prolong their life by keeping the floral stems rehydrated. Carefully recut the stems using sharp scissors or secateurs roughly 2cm from the base of the stems and place into fresh room temperature water.<\/p>\n<p>We suggest using room temperature water, as cold water slows down the hydration process whereas hot or warm water will cause your flowers to sweat and lose all-important moisture. When recutting your stems, it\u2019s best to do so on an angle, as this creates a larger surface area for water absorption as the base of the stems won\u2019t be sitting flush against the bottom of the vase.<\/p>\n<h5>KEEP YOUR FLOWERS HAPPY<\/h5>\n<p>To keep your <a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\/shop-florist-online\/fresh-flowers\/\">beautiful florals<\/a> happy for as long as possible, it\u2019s best to try and mimic their natural conditions by following a few simple flower care tips. Keep your flowers away from direct sunlight, draughts and overly warm areas in your home. Unlike potted plants, cut flowers won\u2019t benefit from direct sunlight &#8211; it will actually cause them to age more quickly, which is the opposite of what we want! Instead, choose a nice, naturally cool spot in your home. Air conditioning will reduce the lifespan of your flowers, so be sure to keep them away from air conditioning vents. Before placing on any furniture, ensure the base of the vase is completely dry to avoid any potential damage, which may cause watermarks.<\/p>\n<h5>ONGOING MAINTENANCE<\/h5>\n<p>One of the best flower care tips we have for you is not to just place your arrangement and hope for the best. By following a few simple steps every few days, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy your stunning luxury florals for longer and keep them looking as fresh as they did when they arrived.<\/p>\n<p>Trimming the stems of your florals every two days will help them stay hydrated and fresh. Trimming around 2cm on an angle each time should be enough to remove any segments of the stem that are looking brown or scabbed.<\/p>\n<p>Removing excess leaves will also help to keep your arrangement looking fresh and luxurious by ensuring that all the clean water your florals are drinking is going straight to the head of the flower. Removing leaves that are starting to brown will also refresh the whole appearance of your arrangement, much the same way you would maintain a potted plant.<\/p>\n<p>A secondary benefit to trimming the foliage is to keep the water nice and clean and not allow any foliage to be below the waterline. Foliage in the water can cause bacteria to grow, and your florals will absorb everything in the water, even if it\u2019s not good for them. Bacteria will cause the stems to rot and will shorten the life of your cut florals significantly. This is why you might have noticed that the flower water, when not maintained and refreshed will have a strong and unpleasant smell. Such a smell is definitely not normal for a healthy arrangement and can absolutely be avoided by following these flower care tips.<\/p>\n<h5>WHAT YOU&#8217;LL NEED<\/h5>\n<p>Flower care tips aren\u2019t just about what you do, but how you do it. Using the proper tools to trim your stems will help immensely, as using scissors that are too blunt will damage the delicate vessels that the flower needs to transport water up the stem. The same way that a butter knife would squish a tomato, it will protect your florals to use florist scissors if you have them, otherwise use the sharpest and most precise tool you can access to ensure a clean cut with no ragged edges.<\/p>\n<p>A clean vase and fresh water is also absolutely essential for caring for your cut florals. As we mentioned earlier, florals are a beauty of the natural world and to maintain them in a vase, it helps to think of how they would grow naturally. Usually, the roots of a flower filters out bacteria, ensuring the water the flower itself is receiving is clean and pure. Air drying your vase after washing with hot soapy water or in the dishwasher is a simple flower care tip that can help keep your vessel free of anything that could harm your flowers.<\/p>\n<h5>FRESH WATER<\/h5>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\/shop-florist-online\/\">Cut flowers<\/a> are unable to regulate their environment via their root system, so it\u2019s up to us to ensure their water is always fresh, clean and free of bacteria and fungi. The best way to do this is to ensure that if your arrangement didn\u2019t come in a vase that you use one that is nice and clean and free of residue from previous cut florals. Also, continually refresh the water in the vase at least every few days or sooner if you notice the water is looking discoloured.<\/p>\n<p>Rinse the stems before placing them back in the water to ensure they are free of any bacteria that may have formed.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h5>CARING FOR POTTED ORCHID PLANTS<\/h5>\n<p>We\u2019ve put together a whole blog on Phalaenopsis Orchids and their care.
