Care instructions are included with every floral order to help increase the life span of your flowers. However, products sold on this website are a perishable, natural item and flowers life span is dependent on species, resulting in some flower varieties living longer than others. Flowers are a product of nature; availability is dependent on season and markets. As a result, not all goods produced are as pictured on www.lullyandrose.com.au, by accepting these terms you are acknowledging there may be discrepancies between images and produced goods.<\/p>\n<h3><em>Variations to botanical\/perishable materials\/flower selection<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>No varieties of any fresh cut botanical materials can ever be guaranteed. This is due to natural growing, supply chain rejections, quarantine restrictions, demand and seasonal availability.\u00a0Lully &amp; Rose Floral Studio\u00a0do not guarantee nor specify any specific flower varieties or flower colours.\u00a0Lully &amp; Rose Floral Studio\u00a0will only use the best seasonal flowers available at the time of the event and suitable substitutes that we see professionally fit may be used\u00a0in selecting flower varieties and flower colours suitable for your floral arrangement\/s.<\/p>\n<p>Lully &amp; Rose Floral Studio accepts no liability on behalf of growers, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.petalpeddlers.com.au\">wholesalers<\/a>, agents (and similar) for not supplying the correct product and\/or service. A decision may be made on our behalf by any of the aforementioned to complete the supply for the order as they see professionally fit.<\/p>\n<h3><em>Sizing Variations<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>Where measurements have been provided for\u00a0floral arrangements, this sizing is a guide only. Floral arrangements\u00a0are created using flowers that vary in size and shape throughout their natural season.\u00a0 This can affect the sizing of the products we provide, making\u00a0floral\u00a0arrangements slightly smaller or larger.\u00a0Lully &amp; Rose Floral Studio (the business)\u00a0accepts no responsibility for variations in size.<\/p>\n<h3>WHEN YOU MAY MAKE A CHANGE TO YOUR ORDER<\/h3>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that our products are made to order and so we cannot generally accommodate requests for changes or cancellations.

You must ensure the address for delivery is appropriate, particularly when you are authorising us to leave your order if nobody is home, and you must ensure our delivery partner can access that location (e.g. apartments and units within a secured complex). Alternatively, Lully &amp; Rose Floral Studio reserves the right to contact the recipient prior to delivery to arrange an appropriate delivery time\/location.<\/p>\n<p>While we make all attempts to get your order to the recipient safely, Lully &amp; Rose Floral Studio is not liable for orders that are stolen, damaged, or lost due to being left unattended at your requested delivery address in circumstances where you have given us an authority to leave.<\/p>\n<p>If the recipient is not at home to accept your order, our couriers will leave the order at your requested location (if authority has been given) at the allocated delivery address. Our couriers will call and\/or send a text message advising the recipient that a delivery has been made. We (and our couriers) reserve all rights to determine whether the nominated delivery address is safe and appropriate to leave your order unattended. If authority has been provided to leave the item if the recipient is not home, yet it is deemed unsafe to leave the order at the door, we may arrange for the item to be returned to our studio. If returned to our studio, we will contact you to arrange a redelivery (redelivery fees will apply) or to arrange collection.<\/p>\n<p>If you do not provide authority to leave the goods unattended, you may collect them from Lully &amp; Rose Floral Studio, or they may be redelivered to you.

This is why we send all our florals out in water. Once we dispatch our flowers, a number of changes in conditions may result in their longevity being reduced. Environmental factors such as air conditioning, extreme heat or changes in climate may have an adverse effect on the flowers.<\/p>\n<h3>ALCOHOL<\/h3>\n<p>It is against the law to sell or supply alcohol to, or to obtain alcohol on behalf of, a person under the age of 18 years. If you have ordered alcohol, an adult must receive and sign for the delivery. If we believe the receiver to be under 18 years of age they may be asked to show I.D.
