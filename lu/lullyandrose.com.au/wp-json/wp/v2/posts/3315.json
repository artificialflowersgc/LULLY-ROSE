To help you care for your seasonal flowers, we&#8217;ve compiled these essential flower care tips.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Receiving Your Flowers<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Upon receiving your fresh flowers, be sure to unwrap them with care to make sure that none of the petals become damaged or bruised. If your flowers have been arranged by us, please keep the tie around the stems intact to maintain their structure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">We deliver all LULLY &amp; ROSE flowers wrapped in fresh water to ensure they arrive dewy and hydrated, retaining moisture throughout their journey to you. This helps to prolong their life by keeping the floral stems rehydrated. If they dry out in transport, this limits the overall capacity of the flowers to absorb water for the lifetime of your cut flowers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Prepping Your Flowers<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">When you&#8217;re ready to display your flowers, carefully recut the stems using very sharp scissors or secateurs roughly 2cm from the base of the stems and place them into fresh room temperature water. We suggest using room temperature water, as cold water slows down the hydration process, whereas hot or warm water will cause your flowers to sweat and lose all-important moisture. When recutting your stems, it\u2019s best to do so on an angle, as this creates a larger surface area for water absorption, preventing the stems from sitting flush against the bottom of the vase. Also, remove any excess foliage that will be submerged in the water to prevent bacterial growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Caring For Your Flowers <\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">To keep your beautiful flowers happy for as long as possible, it\u2019s best to try and mimic their natural conditions by following a few simple flower care tips. To ensure your flowers stay fresh, keep them away from direct sunlight, drafts, and air conditioning vents. Direct sunlight doesn&#8217;t benefit cut flowers as they are already perfectly bloomed and don\u2019t need the extra light and heat. Instead, it causes them to age more quickly, which is the opposite of what we want!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Instead, choose a nice, naturally cool spot in your home. Air conditioning will reduce the lifespan of your flowers, and both hot or cold air will dry them out so be sure to keep them away from air conditioning vents. Before placing on any furniture, ensure the base of the vase is completely dry to avoid any potential damage, which may cause watermarks or staining.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">\u00a0Trim the stems every two days and change the water regularly to maintain freshness. Additionally, clean your vase thoroughly before each refill to prevent bacteria buildup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Ongoing Maintenance<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">One of the best flower care tips we have for you is not to just place your arrangement and hope for the best. By following a few simple steps every few days, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy your beautiful flowers for longer and keep them looking as fresh as they did when they arrived.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">The same way you did when they first arrived, trimming the stems of your flowers every two days will help them stay hydrated and fresh. Trimming around 2cm on an angle each time should be enough to remove any segments of the stem that are looking brown or scabbed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Removing excess leaves will also help to keep your arrangement looking fresh and luxurious by ensuring that all the clean water your flowers drink goes straight to the head of the flower rather than trying to rehydrate leaves that have now dried out. Removing leaves that are starting to brown will also refresh the whole appearance of your arrangement, much the same way you would maintain a potted plant.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">A secondary benefit to trimming the foliage is to keep the water nice and clean and not allow any foliage to be below the waterline. Foliage in the water can cause bacteria to grow, and your florals will absorb everything in the water, even if it\u2019s not good for them. Bacteria will cause the stems to rot and will shorten the life of your cut florals significantly. Failure to maintain and refresh flower water can lead to a strong, unpleasant smell, which is not normal for a healthy arrangement. By following these flower care tips, you can avoid this issue altogether.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Essential Tools<\/span><b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Flower care tips aren\u2019t just about what you do, but how you do it. Using the proper tools to trim your stems will help immensely, as using scissors that are too blunt will damage the delicate vessels that the flower needs to transport water up the stem and into the head of the flower to nourish the petals. The same way that a butter knife would squish a tomato, it will protect your flowers to use florist scissors if you have them, otherwise use the sharpest and most precise tool you can access to ensure a clean cut with no ragged edges.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Additional Ongoing Maintenance <\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">A clean vase and fresh water is also absolutely essential for caring for your cut flowers. As we mentioned earlier, flowers are a beauty of the natural world and to maintain them in a vase, it helps to think of how they would grow naturally. Usually, the roots of a flower filters out bacteria, ensuring the water the flower itself is receiving is clean and pure. Air drying your vase after washing with hot soapy water or in the dishwasher is a simple flower care tip that can help keep your vessel free of anything that could harm your flowers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Cut flowers are unable to regulate their environment via their root system, so it\u2019s up to us to ensure their water is always fresh, clean and free of bacteria and fungi. When changing the water, allow it to sit for a few moments before placing your flowers back in to allow any bubbles from the tap water to subside, as these can also impact the ability of your flowers to absorb water efficiently. Rinse the stems before placing them back in the water to ensure they are free of any bacteria that may have formed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Order Online from LULLY &amp; ROSE Floral Studio<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\">LULLY &amp; ROSE<\/a> is a boutique floral design studio located in the heart of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Gold+Coast+QLD\/\">Gold Coast<\/a>, and is a haven of fresh, perfumed, textured florals and foliages.
