You may even have had peonies in your bridal bouquet, making them even more meaningful!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Language of Phalaenopsis Orchid<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Phalaenopsis orchids, also known as moth orchids, are available in both their natural tones of white, and purple, and imported tinted varieties such as mocha or black. Whether freshly cut or potted, phalaenopsis orchids make a perfect gift for many occasions such as newborn arrivals, housewarmings and more. Symbolic of pure love, beauty, luxury and toughness, the elegant and refined phalaenopsis orchid is sure to surprise and delight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Language of Poppy<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Poppy flowers are a much loved floral and hold special significance. Poppies characteristically have four or six large, delicate, paper petals which create a deep bowl shape around their fringed centre. You most often see them in red, orange, yellow, lemon, peach, and white hues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Red poppies are a symbol of war remembrance all over the world. In Australia are worn or included in wreaths on Remembrance Day and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anzac_Day\">ANZAC Day<\/a>. Poppies have ANZAC Day significance as they were flowering in Turkey in April 1915 when the ANZACs landed at Gallipoli. They continue to flower in the region every spring. Some other colours of poppy flowers;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">White poppies to symbolise peace and remembrance for all casualties of war.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Purple poppies to represent remembrance of animals lost during war.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Black poppies to commemorate all of those who have died. Or are dying as a result of war and the complicated legacy it leaves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Language of Queen Anne&#8217;s Lace<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Queen Anne\u2019s lace is a fern-like plant in a shape reminiscent of a burst of fireworks. Tall, textured stems hold a starburst cluster of little white flowers which emanate from a dark centre. In the language of flowers, Queen anne\u2019s lace represents safety, refuge and a happy home. Moreover, other legends suggest that Queen Anne left a single drop of blood at the dark center of the flower as she completed a challenge to create lace as beautiful as a flower.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Language of Ranunculus<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Ranunculus flowers, also known as buttercups, are a picture perfect floral with a rose-like shape. Their delicate petals are like tissue paper forming protective swirls around a green centre to create a beautiful layered appeal. You can select ranunculus flowers based on colour meanings, making them suitable for a variety of occasions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Pink for romance, love, sympathy and admiration.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Orange for positivity, joy, and happiness.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.4px;\">Red for passion and romantic love.<br \/>\n<\/span>Lemon for friendship and joy, purple for elegance, beauty and charm.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">White for elegance, pure love, innocence and grace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Language of Roses<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Would a rose by any other name smell as sweet? We think so! People often choose roses for various occasions because they bestow significant meaning through their colours. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Red roses traditionally symbolize romantic love, while pinks suggest sweetness: dark pink roses symbolise gratitude, and their light pink counterparts often express gratitude or sympathy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Peach roses, on the other hand, represent harmony, peace, and sincerity. In the secret language of flowers, lavender roses can mean enchantment, splendour and love at first sight. Additionally in more vibrant tones, orange roses are symbolic of friendship and love. Where lemon roses are for luck, platonic friendship and joy. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Furthermore, white roses, like many white flowers and their meanings, symbolise purity and virtue. They often serve as sympathy flowers or adorn bridal bouquets to symbolise the purity of a new love.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">How much do you know about the secret language of flowers? Most well known for its popularity in Victorian times, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Language_of_flowers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">floriography<\/a> is the study of the hidden meanings in gifting certain florals. These florals and their meanings, are sure to take your heart, just like they have ours! Which will you choose to include in your next fresh flower arrangement?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS (S-Z)<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Welcome to the language of flowers (S-Z) of our flower language blog! Here<\/span> <span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">at LULLY &amp; ROSE Floral Studio, we have the privilege and pleasure of seeing the stunning perfumed florals we work with going out into the world and expressing for our clients what words alone simply cannot. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 14.4px; font-family: europa-light;\">As florists, we continually draw inspiration from the beautiful moments we participate in and from the natural beauty of flowers themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Language of Scabiosa<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">The sweet and fragrant scabiosa flowers, also commonly known as pincushion flowers, belong to the honeysuckle family. Their name comes from both their unique appearance and their medicinal use in medieval times to treat scabies and other itchy skin conditions. With their official name derived from the Latin word \u2018scabere\u2019 meaning to scratch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Their numerous clustered florets gives them the appearance of a delicate pincushion, hence their colloquial name. Coming in shades of creamy white, mauve, pinks and burgundy, this cottage garden style floral is beautifully textured and open.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Symbolising peace, love and purity in the secret language of flowers, it\u2019s the perfect addition to your next arrangement. Gift inspiration for scabiosa flowers could be a housewarming for peace in the home, purity for a newborn arrival. Additionally an expression of love for your partner, friend, or a special family member. If you\u2019re a little on the crafty side, these florals also dry out well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Language of Snapdragons<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">These annual flowers are well known, but we think their striking dragon\u2019s head appearance is anything but common! They look incredible when paired with other floral varieties, and add a unique dimension and texture to your arrangements. We love them as part of a market-style wrap, with their diverse range of colours from classic whites to striking burgundy, apricot, mauve and lemon tones. In the secret language of flowers, snapdragons represent strength and grace &#8211; a perfect gift for someone you admire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Language of Spray Rose<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">We could talk all day about the versatile, delicate and simply gorgeous spray rose! Spray roses are a dainty miniature version of a classic rose, and have several flower heads per stem for an elegant, loosely clustered effect. Flower meanings for spray roses follow the same colour patterns as traditional roses;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Red for romance and love.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Lavender for a new love interest.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Lemon for friendship and warmth.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">White for purity, innocence and eternity.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Pink for grace and femininity.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Orange and peach for passion, energy and vibrance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Whatever you need to say, you can say it with spray roses!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Language of Stock<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Stocks, a beautiful tall-stemmed variety similar to snapdragons, exude a heady, sweet, and slightly spicy fragrance, typical of cottage garden style flowers. If you\u2019re interested in gifting based on the secret language of flowers, consider stock, as they symbolise a happy home and a contented life. For this reason, we love these flowers as part of a housewarming gift!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Language of Sweet Pea<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">What could be sweeter than sweet pea flowers and their meanings? These stunning butterfly-like florals resemble climbing plants that produce upright flower clusters. Symbolising good wishes, friendship, kindness, and goodbyes, these flowers make a lovely gift for a wide range of occasions. From celebrating a friend\u2019s successes to wishing someone well &#8211; not many florals bear the meaning of goodbyes. So this is a lovely one to include in a going away gift or a farewell for someone\u2019s last day at work. Available in a beautiful colour palette of whites, peach, and mauves, sweet pea flowers are always an excellent choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Language of Tuberose<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">The tuberose, with its distinctively shaped and elegant appearance, emits a strong scent, making its extract popular for use as a note in perfumery. Their leaves are upright and strappy in appearance, and are a lush green to fill out your arrangement. Its delicate clusters of slim white trumpeted bulbs make it a unique and beautiful flower, aligned with purity, peace, and innocence. The flowers also have a reputation for protecting from evil spirits, making them a popular and appropriate choice to wear as buttonhole flowers for weddings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Language of Tulip<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Tulips are a classic and elegant choice for gifting flower, and are a favourite flower for many people. The tulip industry originated in Holland, a region of The Netherlands, when botanist Carolus Clusius received tulip bulbs from the ambassador to the sultan. Clusius privately grew the bulbs in his own collection, but when he refused to sell or share the gorgeous flowers with others, raiders frequently targeted his gardens. Thus, the tulip industry began, and we are glad it did!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Tulips, known as the national flower of the Netherlands, attract over a million visitors per year to the famous colourful flower fields. If you haven\u2019t seen the stunning images of these tulip fields, be sure to look them up now! There are also some gorgeous tulip farms here in Australia, with some of the most well known ones being in Tasmania.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Reminiscent of an upside down ball gown or ballerina skirt, the most popular variety of tulips are the Hollandia tulips. With those perfectly shaped bulb-like flowers with deeply coloured stamens in the centre.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Instantly recognisable, tulip flowers are representative of a deep and unconditional love. They are a perfect gift option for someone you share a deep connection with, whether that be a romantic partner, friend or close family member. They\u2019re also a stunning pick me up to show yourself some love, you deserve it!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Language of Veronica<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Once you&#8217;ve seen them, you&#8217;ll become obsessed with veronica flowers, a lesser-known floral variety! Veronica flowers, known as speedwell, gypsyweed, or bird&#8217;s eye, evoke the imagery of someone plucking them straight from a magical fairy garden. They feature tall spires of tiny flowers in shades of white and pink and also emit a subtle fragrance. These flowers symbolise loyalty, making them a versatile flower for gifting and a particularly meaningful choice for weddings and anniversaries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Language of Zinnia<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">From the same family as daisies and sunflowers, it\u2019s no surprise that the vibrant and colourful zinnia flowers bring joy wherever they go! Zinnia flowers boast perfectly rounded shapes with numerous delicately shaped petals, occasionally exhibiting an ombre effect from the outer edges towards their broad, flat centre. Available in an array of vibrant colours, you\u2019ll find zinnias in shades of pinks, lemon, coral, and green. With fresh and open flower heads, these welcoming florals are symbolic of acclaim, affection, friendship, everlasting love, remembrance, and tribute. This makes them perfect for gifting on any occasion<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">The Secret Language Of Flowers<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Here at LULLY &amp; ROSE, we have the privilege and pleasure of seeing the stunning perfumed florals we work with going out into the world and expressing for our clients what words alone simply cannot.
