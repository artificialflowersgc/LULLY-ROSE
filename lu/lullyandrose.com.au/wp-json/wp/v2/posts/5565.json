Back in 1908, Anna Marie Jarvis organised a church memorial ceremony in Grafton, West Virginia, to honour her mother, who had provided care to wounded soldiers during the American Civil War. She sent 500 white carnations to attendees, setting the stage for the tradition of using carnations to remember mothers who have passed away. Today, red and pink carnations symbolise and honour living mothers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Gifting flowers with LULLY &amp; ROSE<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">We recognise that motherhood is diverse and it\u2019s important to us that we can help you celebrate your loved ones or yourself on Mother\u2019s Day.
