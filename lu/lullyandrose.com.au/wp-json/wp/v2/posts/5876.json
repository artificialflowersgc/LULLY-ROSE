During this difficult time, showing sympathy and support to the bereaved family is a thoughtful gesture that can provide comfort &amp; solace. One way tco express sympathy is by sending flowers, as they have a unique ability to convey emotions that words cannot.<\/p>\n<p>At LULLY &amp; ROSE Floral Studio, we are here to offer our support &amp; compassion during this difficult time. We understand the importance of expressing your emotions through thoughtful floral arrangements, and we are dedicated to helping you find the perfect way to show your sympathy. Here are some gentle ways that flowers can convey your message of comfort<\/p>\n<h4>CHOOSE FLOWERS WITH SYMBOLIC MEANING<\/h4>\n<p>For a long time, people have chosen flowers to express emotions, utilising their unique capacity to communicate intangible sentiments. When expressing condolences, the choice of flowers greatly influences the impact of your gesture. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s essential to select flowers with symbolic meaning that convey the right message of support &amp; comfort.<\/p>\n<p>White flowers are the most common choice for sympathy arrangements because they symbolise purity, innocence, and peace. These flowers are often used to convey the message that the deceased has moved on to a better place and that their soul has been cleansed of any impurities. Lilies, Roses, and Chrysanthemums are some of the most popular white flowers used in sympathy arrangements.<\/p>\n<p>Lilies are a particularly popular choice as they symbolise the restored innocence of the soul of the deceased. They are often used in arrangements to convey the message that the deceased has moved on to a better place and that their soul is at peace. Roses, on the other hand, can symbolise love, respect, and admiration, making them a fitting choice for an arrangement that celebrates the life of the deceased. Chrysanthemums are often associated with death and are traditional flowers for funerals in some cultures.<\/p>\n<p>When selecting flowers for a <a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\/sympathy-arrangements-gold-coast\/\">sympathy arrangement<\/a>, it&#8217;s also essential to consider the recipient&#8217;s cultural or religious beliefs. In certain cultures, white flowers aren&#8217;t suitable for funerals, and lemon flowers as they are associated with joy &amp; happiness. It&#8217;s essential to do your research and consult with a <a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\/florists-near-me\">professional florist<\/a> to guide you through the process of selecting the appropriate flowers for the occasion.<\/p>\n<h4>CONSIDER THE DECEASED&#8217;S FAVOURITE FLOWERS<\/h4>\n<p>When selecting flowers for a sympathy arrangement, consider incorporating the deceased&#8217;s favourite flowers. This gesture serves as a beautiful tribute to the departed loved one. It is also an excellent way to show the bereaved family that you are aware of their loved one&#8217;s likes and dislikes.<\/p>\n<p>Choosing the deceased&#8217;s favourite flowers for a sympathy arrangement is a touching way to show that you remember &amp; honour them. Incorporating their preferred florals can add a personal touch to the arrangement and make it more meaningful. By incorporating the deceased&#8217;s favourite flowers, you are honouring their memory and providing comfort to those who are mourning their loss.<\/p>\n<h4>SEND A PLANT AS A LASTING TRIBUTE<\/h4>\n<p>Sending a flowering plant as a sympathy gift has become increasingly popular in recent years. Flowering plants are not only beautiful, but they also offer a long-lasting tribute to the deceased, serving as a constant reminder of their life &amp; legacy. They can also bring a sense of peace &amp; tranquillity to the bereaved family&#8217;s home during a difficult time.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\/shop\/flowers-gold-coast\/cut-phalaenopsis-stem\/\">Phalaenopsis Orchids<\/a> are also a popular choice for sympathy arrangements. These elegant and beautiful flowers come in a variety of colours and are often associated with love, strength, and resilience. Orchids are a symbol of endurance and can serve as a reminder to the bereaved family that they have the strength to get through this difficult time.<\/p>\n<div class=\"woocommerce \"><div class=\"products row row-small large-columns-4 medium-columns-3 small-columns-2\">\n<div class=\"product-small col has-hover product type-product post-410 status-publish first instock product_cat-indoor-plants-florist-gold-coast has-post-thumbnail taxable shipping-taxable purchasable product-type-variable has-default-attributes\">\n\t<div class=\"col-inner\">\n\t\n<div class=\"badge-container absolute left top z-1\">\n\n<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"product-small box \">\n\t\t<div class=\"box-image\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"image-fade_in_back\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\/shop\/indoor-plants-florist-gold-coast\/potted-orchid-indoor-plant\/\" aria-label=\"Potted Orchid\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"435\" height=\"541\" src=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/White-phalaenopsis-orchid-plants-potted-in-a-white-fish-bowl-ceramic-planter-same-day-indoor-plant-delivery-Gold-Coas-435x541.jpg\" class=\"attachment-woocommerce_thumbnail size-woocommerce_thumbnail\" alt=\"White phalaenopsis orchid plants potted in a white fish bowl ceramic planter, same day indoor plant delivery Gold Coas\" \/>\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"image-tools is-small top right show-on-hover\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"image-tools is-small hide-for-small bottom left show-on-hover\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"image-tools grid-tools text-center hide-for-small bottom hover-slide-in show-on-hover\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"box-text box-text-products\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"title-wrapper\"><h4 class=\"woocommerce-loop-product__title\"><a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\/shop\/indoor-plants-florist-gold-coast\/potted-orchid-indoor-plant\/\" class=\"woocommerce-LoopProduct-link woocommerce-loop-product__link keychainify-checked\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Potted Orchid<\/a><\/h4><\/div><div class=\"price-wrapper\">\n\t<span class=\"price\"><span class=\"woocommerce-Price-amount amount\"><bdi><span class=\"woocommerce-Price-currencySymbol\">&#36;<\/span>115.00<\/bdi><\/span> <small class=\"woocommerce-price-suffix\">incl GST<\/small><\/span>\n<\/div>\t\t<p class=\"box-excerpt is-small\">\n\t\t\tFor our Orchid lovers, our deluxe potted Orchid plants are a symbol of luxury and refined taste.

With proper care, plants can last for months or even years, serving as a constant reminder of the love and memories shared with the departed loved one.<\/p>\n<h4>PERSONALISE THE ARRANGEMENT<\/h4>\n<p>Personalising the flower arrangement is a great way to show that you put thought and care into your sympathy gesture. Adding a special item or memento that belonged to the deceased, such as a piece of jewellery, a book, or favourite item, can be a meaningful way to honour their memory. Another idea is to include a special note or a quote that was important to the deceased or the family.<\/p>\n<p>Personalisation extends to selecting flowers or colours with significance. For avid gardeners, incorporating blooms from their garden or <a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\/shop\/indoor-plant-and-house-plants-delivery-gold-coast\/\">floral plants<\/a> they loved. If the loved one had a favourite colour, you may choose flowers in that colour to include in the arrangement.<\/p>\n<p>Personalising a sympathy floral arrangement shows you recognise the unique bond between the family and their loved one. You can accomplish this in various ways, such as incorporating a special item, a beloved photograph, or meaningful flowers. A personalised arrangement can provide comfort and solace to the bereaved family during a difficult time.<\/p>\n<h4>ACCOMPANY FLOWERS WITH A THOUGHTFUL MESSAGE<\/h4>\n<p>Accompanying the flowers with a thoughtful message can make a significant impact during a difficult time. A simple message expressing your condolences, support, and sympathy can provide immense comfort to the bereaved family. Consider adding a personalised note or a quote that holds special meaning to the deceased or the family. Here are some examples of messages you can include with your sympathy flowers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;May these flowers bring you comfort &amp; peace during this difficult time.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Our thoughts and prayers are with you and your family. Please accept these flowers as a token of our sympathy.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;We are deeply sorry for your loss. These florals are a small gesture to show you that we care.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;With heartfelt sympathy, we send these flowers to honour and remember your loved one.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;We hope these florals bring a little bit of beauty and comfort to your day remembering your beloved family member.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Remember to keep your message brief and heartfelt, and always sign your name at the end. You must ensure the written message suits the relationship you shared with the deceased and their family.<\/p>\n<p>At LULLY &amp; ROSE, we understand the importance of choosing the right florals for a sympathy arrangement.
