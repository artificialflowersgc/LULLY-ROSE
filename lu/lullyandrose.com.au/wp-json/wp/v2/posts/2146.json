Therefore, florals are intrinsically linked to celebrating wedding anniversaries, as it stands to reason. Whether it\u2019s that delicate perfume that reminds you of the moment you walked down the aisle, or the colours and aesthetic of a special flower that will always signify the day you and your partner became married and stepped into the next stage of your lives together. There\u2019s nothing more romantic than luxurious wedding anniversary flowers!<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the centuries florals have been used in weddings and symbolic anniversary gifts have tied certain flowers to relationship milestones. A perfect way to mark the love and growth between you and your partner is selecting a flower that symbolises your relationship. Florals symbolise the love you share, bringing nature&#8217;s beauty into your home with a stunning wedding anniversary arrangement<\/p>\n<p>At LULLY &amp; ROSE, we adore LOVE, and nothing delights us more than creating beautiful arrangements for your special moments. We\u2019ve put together this guide to which florals you could include in your posy of wedding anniversary flowers, but of course there are no hard and fast rules.<\/p>\n<div class=\"container section-title-container\" ><h2 class=\"section-title section-title-center\"><b><\/b><span class=\"section-title-main\" style=\"font-size:65%;color:rgb(218, 175, 173);\">1st Anniversary with Carnations<\/span><b><\/b><\/h2><\/div>\n<p>The traditional floral for celebrating the first wedding anniversary is carnations, and many couples will have had these delicate, fluffy flowers featured in their wedding. This makes them extra special wedding anniversary flowers!<\/p>\n<p>Carnations represent passionate love and commitment and are often chosen for the first anniversary because of their association with young, passionate love. One of the original flower meanings passed down over the centuries for carnations is that a posy of fresh carnations would cause immediate and lasting love, a beautiful sentiment to refresh on the first anniversary of your wedding. Like many flowers, the colour you choose for your carnations has meaning too: red carnations represent love, pride, friendship, passion and admiration; white carnations represent innocence, purity and pure love; and the pink carnation symbolises the unforgettable nature of the recipient, radiating joy and a promised long lasting commitment. In our book, they\u2019re all stunning choices and you really can\u2019t go wrong with this classic first wedding anniversary floral!<\/p>\n<div class=\"container section-title-container\" ><h2 class=\"section-title section-title-center\"><b><\/b><span class=\"section-title-main\" style=\"font-size:65%;color:rgb(218, 175, 173);\">2nd Anniversary with Lily of the Valley &amp; Cosmos<\/span><b><\/b><\/h2><\/div>\n<p>For your second wedding anniversary flowers, opt for Lily of the Valley and Cosmos florals &#8211; the symbol of devotion and pure love in your relationship, and the playfulness that comes with this stage in your relationship.
