Whether you can hand deliver them yourself or not, get well soon flowers are the perfect gift to let them know you\u2019re thinking of them and to say you love them with more than just words. In our experience, florals always say what words cannot express.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Get Well Soon Flowers<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When you order your get well soon flowers from <a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\">Gold Coast Florist<\/a> LULLY &amp; ROSE Floral Studio, you can rest assured that your loved one will receive a luxury arrangement created with love and attention to detail, and delivered with the same care and compassion. No matter what they\u2019re going through, get well soon flowers are sure to brighten their day and make them feel loved and appreciated.<\/p>\n<h5>Floral Therapy<\/h5>\n<p>Did you know that flowers have been proven to encourage recovery and lift spirits? Studies have shown that flowers have a positive short and long-term effect on mood and research participants reported feeling less depressed, anxious and agitated after receiving flowers, and even demonstrated an elevated sense of enjoyment and satisfaction with life. There are so many occasions that are appropriate to send flowers on, so don\u2019t hesitate to show your support, sympathy and encouragement with a luxury arrangement of fresh, seasonal florals from Gold Coast florist LULLY &amp; ROSE Floral Studio &#8211; they might just help even more than you know.<\/p>\n<h5>The Science Behind Flowers Boosting Well-being<\/h5>\n<p>According to behavioural research conducted at Rutgers &#8211; The State University of New Jersey, flowers have a measurable effect on human emotions. \u201cWhat\u2019s most exciting about this study is that it challenges established scientific beliefs about how people can manage their day-to-day moods in a healthy and natural way,\u201d said Jeannette Haviland-Jones, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology at Rutgers and lead researcher on the study.<\/p>\n<p>The study showed that women who received flowers always displayed a true smile, and still reported a heightened positive mood three days after the event and that in both men and women, flowers promoted more positive social interaction than other stimuli. In participants over the age of 55, flowers had an immediate impact on mood as well as an improvement in episodic memory. With this in mind, you know that your get well soon flowers will be doing more than just looking lovely, and will actually have a measurable positive impact on your loved ones! We love that the science is proving what we intuitively know about the power of nature.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re not surprised that flowers have a positive effect on mood, after all, we love them so much we made a career out of them. As a Gold Coast florist, it\u2019s a pleasure to be a part of bringing joy to people through the natural world in the form of seasonal, perfumed florals and foliages.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Top Tips For Sending Get Well Soon Flowers<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>Choose Something That Has Its Own Vessel<\/h5>\n<p>Some hospitals may not allow loose bouquets of flowers to be delivered as there may be nowhere safe and convenient to put them, so it\u2019s best to opt for something that already has a vase. We have you covered with our Designer Floral Bowl, a seasonal florals arrangement, arranged in a hand cast ceramic \u2018Cloud Bubble Vase\u2019 designed in Australia by \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/marmosetfound.com.au\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Marmoset Found<\/a>\u2018. Potted Phalaenopsis Orchids are another wonderful choice and will certainly give your loved one\u2019s room a touch of elegance while brightening the space with natural colours. Our premium tall stemmed potted Phalaenopsis Orchids\u00a0are arranged in a contemporary white ceramic vase adorned with a rose gold ribbon and presented in our signature gift box accented with white tissue.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re sending get well soon flowers to the person\u2019s home, choosing an arrangement from a local florist, which is already in a vase removes an element of fussing on the part of the recipient so they can enjoy their gorgeous florals straight away rather than needing to find a vase or re-arrange their gift if they don\u2019t fit into what they have at home. Plus, they\u2019ll also have the gift of a beautiful new vase that they can enjoy using for years to come.<\/p>\n<h5>Consider Hospital Settings<\/h5>\n<p>When sending get well soon flowers to a hospital or nursing home, it&#8217;s advisable to inquire about any regulations they may have concerning floral deliveries, particularly in areas like intensive care or specialised neonatal units. Ensure you gather all the necessary details, such as the room number, for a seamless delivery experience. With our same day delivery option for orders placed before 11 am, you can act promptly, ensuring your heartfelt message is received promptly. Our specialised floral couriers handle deliveries to the Gold Coast and surrounding areas, ensuring your arrangement arrives fresh and dewy, imbued with the same love, compassion, and care with which it was created.<\/p>\n<h5>Choosing a Fragrance for a Shared Space<\/h5>\n<p>If you&#8217;re aware that your loved one is sharing a hospital room or nursing home space, it&#8217;s important to choose florals without a strong fragrance. While we appreciate the delightful scents of various flowers, it&#8217;s crucial to recognize that not everyone shares the same sentiment. To show consideration for other patients in the vicinity, opt for florals with a more subtle fragrance, avoiding flowers such as Lilies, Freesias, or Hyacinths. Instead, consider options like Roses, Carnations, or Dahlias, which still add beauty without overwhelming scents. These thoughtful choices ensure a pleasant environment for everyone in shared spaces.<\/p>\n<h5>Consider Potential Allergies of Other Patients<\/h5>\n<p>Medical environments might have limited natural airflow, posing challenges for patients, particularly those with allergies. This becomes especially problematic if a roommate receives flowers with abundant pollen that has nowhere to disperse. Opting for allergy-friendly choices like Roses, Carnations, or Chrysanthemums is a beautiful solution, as these flowers contain their pollen within the blossom. These allergy-conscious options are also accessible at LULLY &amp; ROSE.<\/p>\n<h5>Thank Your Medical Team with a Floral Arrangement<\/h5>\n<p>Nurses and doctors dedicate themselves tirelessly, and amidst the emotional challenges of dealing with illness or other circumstances, their efforts are sometimes underappreciated. Consider expressing gratitude by sending a thoughtful arrangement to the ward team where you or your loved one received care. Acknowledge their compassion and support with a gesture that we are certain will bring them joy, and we&#8217;d be delighted to assist in coordinating this for you. Beyond hospitals, floral arrangements also make wonderful gifts for nursing home staff and even veterinarians.<\/p>\n<h5>Add Extra Gifts For A Special Touch<\/h5>\n<p>When the occasion calls for it, you can add something extra to your flower delivery from our range of local artisan gifts for an added touch of luxury and care. At LULLY &amp; ROSE, supporting local businesses is paramount to us, which is why we have curated this beautiful selection of locally made gifts. We have something to delight everyone, and knowing your gift supports local businesses is just the icing on the cake\u2014or, in this case, the delicious filling inside a Loco Love Chocolates Twin Pack.

The only difficult decision is which flavour to choose: the decadent Wild Rose Ganache, sweet Butter Caramel Pecan, or the classic and crunchy Hazelnut Praline.<\/p>\n<p>For those who appreciate home fragrance, our Romy Louise range of candles, locally made here on the Gold Coast, will enchant them.
