Whether they\u2019ve been sent to you for a special occasion or you love to buy florals regularly (or want to start), fresh florals elevate your home and bring a natural vibrance to every day.<\/p>\n<div class=\"container section-title-container\" ><h2 class=\"section-title section-title-center\"><b><\/b><span class=\"section-title-main\" style=\"font-size:65%;color:rgb(218, 175, 173);\">5 Reasons To Buy Flowers For Your Home<\/span><b><\/b><\/h2><\/div>\n<p>Here at <a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\">LULLY &amp; ROSE Floral Studio<\/a>, we are constantly inspired by the natural beauty of flowers and we think you will be too, so we\u2019ve listed our top five reasons to buy flowers for your home! Even better than that, we also offer <a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\/delivery-suburbs-pricing-gold-coast-florist\/\">same day delivery<\/a> across the Gold Coast and surrounding areas for orders placed before 11am, so you can enjoy seasonal, perfumed, textured florals and foliages sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n<h5>1. Positive Impacts on Mental Health<\/h5>\n<p>Did you know that flowers genuinely bring happiness and true smiles, as well as encouraging improved wellbeing, mental health and recovery? Studies have shown that flowers do have a long-term positive effect on mood, with study participants reporting feeling less anxious and agitated after receiving flowers, and over time actually demonstrated a higher sense of enjoyment and life satisfaction. According to behavioural research conducted at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, the simple presence of flowers in a room generates happy emotions in humans and has a positive effect on social behaviour, even improving episodic memory in some cases. \u201cWhat\u2019s most exciting about this study is that it challenges established scientific beliefs about how people can manage their day-to-day moods in a healthy and natural way,\u201d said Jeannette Haviland-Jones, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology at Rutgers and lead researcher on the study.<\/p>\n<p>Intuitively, we know that flowers make us happy, but it\u2019s so exciting to see the science supporting what we have felt to be true all along. As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Gold+Coast+QLD\/\">Gold Coast<\/a> florists, nothing makes us happier than creating contemporary, heartfelt arrangements that bring joy, comfort and healing to the homes they are delivered to! If you\u2019re interested in the &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\/flowers-and-their-meaning-gold-coast\/\">Healing Power Of Flowers<\/a>&#8216;, read more in our feature piece.<\/p>\n<p>Having fresh flowers for your home creates feelings of peace and happiness, something we could all do with a little more of! If you\u2019d like to get started with something simple, we highly recommend our Fresh Florals for Home &#8211; a market style floral wrap designed for you to get creative with and enjoy arranging at home. It\u2019s the perfect wind-down activity which is sure to boost your mood with fresh, seasonal, textured florals and foliages.<\/p>\n<h5>2. Create Stylish Spaces with Florals and Foliages<\/h5>\n<p>Floral arrangements are a classic and timeless design choice to elevate your interior design. They\u2019ll never go out of style, and with a huge range of seasonal florals to work with you\u2019re sure to find something that suits your desired aesthetic. Decorating your home with florals creates ambience and brings a touch of the natural world into your space.<\/p>\n<p>Florals are also a versatile styling tool, allowing you to change colours and varieties to create the look you want and change up your decor effortlessly. With interior design, less is often more and at LULLY &amp; ROSE Floral Studio we couldn\u2019t agree more! We incorporate a contemporary minimalism into our floral designs which perfectly encapsulates this sentiment and our style is a nod to emerging floristry trends in capital cities around the world. We take great care in creating arrangements that feel luxurious, on trend and stylish and yet still uniquely you.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to try styling your home with luxury, seasonal florals and foliages, we recommend one of our designer vase arrangements, which includes a contemporary glass vase suited to a wide range of styles. Our attention to detail ensures that every petal is in place to create the environment you want with flowers for your home.<\/p>\n<p>Ready to really get creative with flowers for your home? Try styling florals in your entryway, in a row on a long dining table, with a cute bedside bowl arrangement, a classic coffee table look or create dimension and vibrancy on bookshelves with a textured arrangement.<\/p>\n<h5>3. Find Your Feng Shui with Flowers<\/h5>\n<p>You\u2019ve probably heard of Feng Shui before, but did you know that flowers are an effective method of stimulating healing energy and the positive flow of sheng chi? The practice of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Feng_shui\">Feng Shui<\/a> protects against negativity and brings good luck by managing the flow of this positive energy. In Feng Shui, real flowers have the strongest healing energy, so using fresh flowers for your home is an effective way to bring this energy into your space &#8211; dried florals are discouraged, but floral motifs can be used if needed.<\/p>\n<p>The most effective florals for Feng Shui though are potted ones, so why not choose a <a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\/shop-florist-online\/plants-gold-coast\/\">potted Phalaenopsis Orchid<\/a> to bring living energy into your home? Orchids are particularly revered in Feng Shui practices, symbolising wealth, good fortune and abundance. While all orchids are representative of these attributes, you can further channel the type of energy you want to call in by choosing a particular colour which matches your intentions. Burgundy and pink orchids welcome in love and romance, and double-headed varieties may be best for this intention to signify a pair. If you need a boost in creativity, coral orchids could be the perfect addition to your workspace to get those juices flowing. White orchids will bring clarity and calm to your home, or shades of peach will bring comfort and stability if this is what you need. For a vibrant spark of joy and optimism, look to lemon orchids for hope. While all orchid varieties have significance, phalaenopsis orchids in particular are believed to improve concentration and calm feelings of anxiety.<\/p>\n<p>Other florals can help you channel your intentions too, and using these flowers for your home is a beautiful way to focus your energy. Flowers in a vase on the right side of the bed are said to bring love into your home &#8211; roses and carnations in a deep burgundy are particularly popular for attracting romance. Pink peonies which are still slightly closed bring the beginnings of love, perfect if you want to ease into a new relationship &#8211; but make sure to arrange them in twos, not alone. Yellow flowers placed in the kitchen bring appetite and happiness and harmony to the home, and purple flowers bring prosperity &#8211; try placing some in your home office to attract business success. If you&#8217;re missing someone special, marigolds are often placed with photographs to honour ancestors.<\/p>\n<p>Flowers for your home can certainly mean more than just decor, and if you\u2019re interested in more flowers and their meanings, be sure to check out our series on &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/lullyandrose.com.au\/the-secret-language-of-flowers-part-one-gold-coast\/\">The Secret Language of Flowers<\/a>&#8216;.<\/p>\n<h5>4.
