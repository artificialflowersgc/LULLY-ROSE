Yet, this day holds significance beyond honoring just one individual. This month, let&#8217;s broaden our perspective and acknowledge the various mum figures who have left indelible marks on our lives in meaningful ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">In Australia, where Mother\u2019s Day coincides with the blossoming of chrysanthemums in May, the association between the flower and the occasion is both symbolic and timely. However, beyond the beauty of flowers lies a deeper significance rooted in the origins of Mother\u2019s Day gifting. Initially conceived as a day to recognise the overlooked individuals and unite communities, Mother\u2019s Day has evolved into a cherished tradition that resonates with people worldwide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">With Mother\u2019s Day just around the corner, it\u2019s an opportune moment to express appreciation and gratitude for the maternal figures in our presence. Whether through heartfelt cards, meaningful gifts, beautiful florals or simply spending quality time together, there are countless ways to make this day truly memorable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Moreover, around the globe, Mother\u2019s Day (Mom&#8217;s Day) is celebrated on different dates, yet its essence remains universal. Originating from Anna Jarvis&#8217;s heartfelt memorial for her mom in the United States, the holiday gained international prominence, including in Australia. Thanks to the pioneering efforts of Mrs. Janet Heyden, who spearheaded a campaign to support marginalised lonely and forgotten mums, Australia embraced Mother\u2019s Day and Mother&#8217;s Day gifting as an annual tribute to maternal affection and sacrifice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Mother&#8217;s Day history<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Flowers, especially carnations, have played a significant symbolic role in the establishment of modern Mother&#8217;s Day traditions. Back in 1908, Anna Marie Jarvis organised a church memorial ceremony in Grafton, West Virginia, to honour her mom, who had provided care to wounded soldiers during the American Civil War. She sent 500 white carnations to attendees, setting the stage for the tradition of using carnations to remember moms who have passed away. Today, red and pink carnations symbolise and honour living moms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">As we prepare to honour mums, let\u2019s not overlook the myriad of other extraordinary women who fulfil maternal roles in our lives. From grandmothers and aunts to friends who gift unwavering support, Mother\u2019s Day is a time to celebrate the diverse array of maternal figures who enrich our world with their love and guidance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Whether she answers by ma, mama, mum, mom, or any other endearing title, the Individual who nurtured and cared for you deserves heartfelt recognition. This Mother\u2019s Day, let&#8217;s extend our gratitude beyond our immediate family and acknowledge the countless women whose love and guidance have shaped our lives and gifted us joy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Mother\u2019s Day fresh flowers and gifts<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">At LULLY &amp; ROSE, we offer a diverse selection of fresh flower options for Mother&#8217;s Day.
