Beyond their visual appeal, flowers offer powerful healing properties when used in natural medicine. We integrate them into herbal remedies through essential oils, teas, edibles, and vitamins.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">We&#8217;d like to shed light on some of these remarkable properties and their significance in healing. However, we always recommend consulting with your doctor or accredited naturopath before trying any new supplements or remedies. This article represents our opinion and perspective only and is not intended as medical advice or recommendations. Always consult your medical professionals first, particularly if you&#8217;re currently taking any medication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">You might be surprised to learn that Western doctors are increasingly advocating for natural remedies. This shift is encouraging for preserving our connection to the natural world and exploring the healing potential of flowers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">For instance, floral remedies can be beneficial in addressing cognitive conditions like memory loss, speech issues, and dyslexia, as well as psychological distress that manifests in physical symptoms such as hypertension, asthma, insomnia, eating disorders, migraines, and allergies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Teas and essential oils derived from flowers can also positively impact emotional wellbeing and promote restful sleep. Natural treatments containing flowers have long been utilised to manage stress and navigate difficult emotions such as fear, grief, and anger. Since we convey emotions through the flowers we choose, it&#8217;s fitting that they can also influence our emotional state and overall wellbeing \u2013 nature truly is remarkable in that regard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Flower Tea<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Flower additions to teas offer a wide array of healing benefits, from elevate immunity and aiding digestion to enhancing mood and promoting better sleep. You may have enjoyed flower teas without realising it, such as the classic chamomile tea commonly used for relaxation at the end of the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Other floral teas known for their calming effects on anxiety and stress include jasmine, lavender, rose, and chrysanthemum. Jasmine, celebrated for its delicate floral flavor, frequently combines with green tea and contributes to lowering blood pressure. Similarly, lavender, another favoured option, harmonises with various teas and florals like delicate rose, offering enjoyment whether hot or iced \u2013 we suggest enhancing it with a hint of honey and lemon for added flavour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Chrysanthemum, a traditional floral in Chinese medicine and culture, yields a light and sweet tasting tea. For immunity boosting or cold relieving benefits, consider linden flower, dandelion, or echinacea teas. Mix with lemon and honey for a soothing, warming beverage with added health perks, including weight management, cholesterol control, and improved skin health. If you prefer iced tea, try hibiscus! Hibiscus boasts a delicious flavor that pairs perfectly with fruits and is rich in antioxidants and other beneficial nutrients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Edible Flowers<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Edible flowers are those you can safely consume, either on their own or as ingredients in cooking. They&#8217;re gaining popularity in the culinary world, prized for both their holistic benefits and their stunning visual appeal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Throughout history, flowers and herbs have adorned dishes in Asian, European, and Middle Eastern cuisines. If you&#8217;re keen to experiment with edible flowers in your cooking for their decorative, flavourful, and health enhancing healing qualities, there are abundant resources to inspire your creativity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Lavender, known for its sweet, citrusy flavour, adds a delightful touch to desserts and baked goods. Nasturtium flowers, though less familiar, pack a punch of vitamin C and make a zesty garnish for salads. They&#8217;re easy to grow and offer a sweet and spicy flavour profile that tantalises the taste buds. Other popular edible flowers known for their healing properties include hibiscus, echinacea, dandelion, honeysuckle, rose, primrose, pansy, chamomile, cornflower, marigold, elderflower, calendula, and dianthus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Essential Oils<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Essential oils, now booming in popularity, trace their origins back to ancient cultures worldwide. The distillation method used today dates as far back as the 11th to the 13th centuries. By 1500, recognisable oils like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.doterra.com\/AU\/en_AU\/p\/cedarwood-oil\">cedarwood<\/a>, rose, rosemary, sage, cinnamon, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.doterra.com\/AU\/en_AU\/p\/myrrh-oil\">myrrh<\/a> had already been formulated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Many modern companies actively formulate proprietary blends of essential oils, often labelling them to highlight their specific benefits or intended use, naming them after the plants they extract from. This simplifies the selection process, especially for newcomers. You may find that your favourite skincare products already harness the benefits of essential oils. These oils can be diffused into the air or applied topically after dilution, though not all oils are suitable for every application. It&#8217;s wise to research and consult an aromatherapist before delving too deeply into their usage. Generally gentle oils include chamomile, rose, jasmine, and lavender.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">A little research boosts confidence in using these potent floral extracts, remembering their high concentration requires caution when experimenting. Essential oils are widely used in aromatherapy to enhance mood, alleviate anxiety, and promote better sleep, among other benefits. Consult your healthcare professional or naturopath to explore their potential therapeutic applications. Always obtain essential oils from reputable, trusted suppliers<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: europa-light;\">Some of the most commonly used flowers and their healing properties in the wellness and holistic health industry are:<\/span><\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\">Healing properties of cornflower flowers<\/span><span style=\"font-family: ivyora-light;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.4px; font-family: europa-light;\">Belonging to the daisy family, Cornflower is known for its anti-inflammatory properties.
