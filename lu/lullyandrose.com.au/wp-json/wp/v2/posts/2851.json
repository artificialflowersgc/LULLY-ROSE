Carnations signify love, fascination, distinction, protection, healing and strength. Snowdrops symbolise innocence and purity.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i>February<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p>For a symbolic February birthday gift for all ages, Violets and Primroses are your go to florals. Violets symbolise honesty, protection, dreams, healing, remembrance and determination. For an extra layer of meaning, look to Native American cultures where the violet is representative of temperance and mental clarity, or the chakra system of Hinduism and Buddhism where violet is the colour of the crown chakra &#8211; the energy centre associated with enlightenment. Primroses, on the other hand, are a dreamy and romantic floral associated with young love and are most often associated with conveying the feeling of not being able to live without your lover \u2013 a perfect birthday gift for your sweetheart.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i>March<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p>For March birthdays, look to the cheery Daffodil and Jonquil flower varieties.
